/**
 * @brief The PlannerLazy class
 * This planner puts the agents in a queue and process them in order.
 * Each agent has a computed path and stays at its last position forever. Note that this
 * last position can be its task or just an intermediate location (if we could not reach the task
 * in the given limit).
 *
 * Note that if I plan a0 (passing by a location L) and a1 (whose task is in L), then a1 stops at L 
 * (we do not compute a full path if it reaches its task) and interrupts the path of a0. I decide not to
 * look for collisions with a1 after she reaches its task nor computing a full path for her that avoids
 * other robots (since that could prevent her from reaching its task). Instead, I prefer to catch any 
 * collision created like this when it arrives and stop the moving agent.
 * Note that I may need to unplan neighboring agents. This is done in PlannerLazy::avoid_collisions
 * 
 * At some point this algorithm got a lot worse than before. I think that the problem was in PlannerLazy::neighbors().
 * I keep the old function in the comments because it was a lot smarter.
