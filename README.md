# The League of Robot Runners Code Archive

Welcome to the code archive for The League of Robot Runners competition!
Each year we gather together all the best implementations from each team, as they appear on the final leaderboard of the main round. 
These implementations serve to lower the barrier of entry, for newcomers to the competition and to the field of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). They 
also allow established researchers in the area to make further progress, by building on successful ideas and by comparing their efforts against an established state-of-the-art. 

## What to find here

The repository is organised by competition year. In the directory for a given year are found directories named after teams, housing their code submissions for different challenge categories.

Each team contributes one or more submissions, with each submission distinguished by a commit hash. We archive all submissions appearing on the final leaderboard of any challenge category. This includes any submission that contributed a virtual best solution by the end of the competition. A README file in the directory of each round provides a summary of all the teams and their submissions, with links to each commit, the achieved score of that entry, and the total errands finished on each evaluation instance.
