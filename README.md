# The League of Robot Runners Code Archive

Welcome to the code archive repository of The League of Robot Runners competition!
At the end of each year's competition, we release the corresponding code submissions for each entry shown on the leaderboard. 
This lowers the barrier for newcomers to the competition and to the field of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), allowing 
researchers to compare with their algorithms and build new approaches based on the successful teams. 

## What to find here

The repository is organised by competition rounds. Each round contains directories named after teams, housing their code submissions for different challenge categories.

You can find the codes from the corresponding commit of each entry on the leaderboard and of each entry that contributed to the virtual best solutions. The table in the readme file of each round directory provides a summary of all the teams and their submissions, including the links to each entry's commit, the total score of each entry, and the total errands finished by each entry on each evaluation instance.
