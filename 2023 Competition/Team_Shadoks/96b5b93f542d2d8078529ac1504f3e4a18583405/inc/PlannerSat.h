/// @brief We compute only one move.
/// @details We sort the agents by distance to their tasks. For each agent, we try to
/// move it towards its tasks, possibly pushing other robots, but without replanning previously
/// (with higher priority) agents. We do this with a conflict solver.
///
/// I use this solver for very dense instances, like random_600, random_800 and game_6500. It cannot avoid congestion
/// because it does not look into the future to see which is the best path (it only looks at the next timestep).
/// It is very fast for random_600 and random_800, it can plan every agent even if we set a high bound (path_bound=600) for
/// the conflict solver
/// The instance game_6500 is much bigger and it cannot plan all agents at every step, so the farthest agents do not move
/// (unless another agent pushes it). I tried planning two agents at the same time for this instance so that every agent
/// is planned, but it gave worse results.
